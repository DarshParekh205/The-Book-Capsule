      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Assets vs. Liabilities:</strong> Focus on acquiring assets that generate income rather than liabilities that take money out of your pocket.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Financial Education:</strong> Schools teach academics, not how to manage money. Financial literacy is key to wealth.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Work to Learn, Not to Earn:</strong> Invest time in learning skills that help you grow financially rather than just earning a paycheck.</li>
      </ul>
