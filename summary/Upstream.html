    <h2>Upstream: How to Solve Problems Before They Happen by Dan Heath</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OqMH30s+L._SX342_.jpg" alt="Upstream cover" />

    <p><strong>Upstream</strong> focuses on a powerful idea: we spend too much time reacting to problems and not enough time preventing them. Dan Heath encourages readers to shift from reactive thinking to proactive, upstream thinking.</p>

    <div class="summary-points">
      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Problem Prevention:</strong> Many problems can be solved before they even occur — if we think ahead.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Systems Thinking:</strong> Solve the root causes, not just symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Overcoming Barriers:</strong> Upstream thinking often faces resistance due to “tunneling,” lack of ownership, or ambiguous accountability.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>This book is a must-read for leaders, problem-solvers, and anyone wanting to build systems that prevent crises rather than constantly respond to them. Heath mixes storytelling and practical strategies to make upstream thinking actionable.</p>
