    <h2>Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XJvnkjcBL._SY466_.jpg" alt="Noise cover" />

    <p><strong>Noise</strong> uncovers an invisible but pervasive problem in decision-making: random variability, or “noise.” While bias is consistent error, noise is inconsistent error, and it’s just as harmful — especially in areas like law, healthcare, hiring, and predictions.</p>

      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. What is Noise:</strong> Noise is unwanted variability in judgments — two experts may give wildly different answers to the same problem.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Bias vs. Noise:</strong> Bias pushes decisions in a specific direction; noise scatters them unpredictably. Both distort judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Noise Audit:</strong> Organizations should perform audits to measure judgment variability among professionals.</li>
      </ul>
